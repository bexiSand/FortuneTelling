                    <p>Originating as a playing deck in the 1430’s Italy, 
                       an additional fifth suit was added to the original four suited deck. 
                       The new suit was made up of 21 cards called trionfi (“triumphs”) and an odd card called il matto (“the fool”).
                       Their function was to act as a suit superior in  power  to the original four suits.
                       <br>
                       Modern tarot card decks consist of 78 cards divided into two groups: the major arcana (which has 22 cards), 
                       also known as trumps, and the minor arcana (which has 56 cards).
                       <br>
                       The cards of the major arcana are illustrated to represent various forces, characters, virtues and vices. 
                       Of the 22 cards, 21 have numerical value. Only the fool doesn’t have a numerical value.
                       <br>
                       The minor arcana is divided into four suits (wands, cups, swords and coins) with 14 cards each. 
                       Four cards are court cards (king, queen, knight, and jack) and 10 are numbered cards.
                       <br>
                       The use of tarot cards in fortune telling first occurred in France around 1780. Each card had a meaning. 
                       The major arcana represented important spiritual matters and the minor arcana, through its four suits, 
                       represented business, love, conflict and money.
                       <br>
                       The practice of using a tarot deck in fortune telling involves the questioner shuffling the deck and the 
                       fortune teller laying out a few cards (picked up by the questioner at random) in a special pattern called a “spread”. 
                       The meaning derived from a card depends on the orientation of the card and the meaning of the cards next to it.
