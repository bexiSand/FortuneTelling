                    <p>Palmistry, also known as <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/chiromancy" class="subtlehref">Chiromancy</a>, the wisdom 
                       follows that you read the lines on a person’s dominant hand, 
                       which is supposed to signify what they have made of their life with 
                       what they were born with, which is separately indicated on the 
                       non-dominant hand. 
                       <br>
                       Common to Eurasia, it has been widely practiced 
                       in Tibet, India, China, Persia, as well as ancient Israel and Babylonia. 
                       The practice evaluates a person’s life and character by reading of 
                       various lines such as the heart line, life line, head line, and fate 
                       line which are interpreted by size, quality, and various intersections 
                       as well as taking into account any significant mounts or bumps. 
                       <br>
                       Other qualities of the hand, such as the shape and size of the palm and 
                       fingers are also interpreted, with the hand being put into one of four shape 
                       categories: earth, air, water, or fire, which correspond to different 
                       personality types.
